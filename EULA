FOR RIPS SOFTWARE
VERSION 1.2

IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY: THIS END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT ("EULA" OR "AGREEMENT") IS A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AS A COMPANY OR A LEGAL ENTITY ("LICENSEE" OR "YOU") AND RIPS TECHNOLOGIES GMBH ("RIPS" OR "LICENSOR") A GERMAN LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY, HAVING ITS REGISTERED OFFICE AT UNIVERSITAETSSTRASSE 142, D-44799 BOCHUM, FOR THE LICENSEE'S TECHNICAL POSSIBILITY TO USE, ON-PREMISE ("ON-PREMISE-VERSION") OR AS A SERVICE ("SAAS-VERSION"), RIPS SOFTWARE AND ALL ITS COMPONENTS (EXECUTABLES, DOCUMENTATION, AND ALL OTHER FILES) ACCOMPANIED BY OR ORDERED BASED ON THIS EULA (COLLECTIVELY "SOFTWARE").

AS LONG AS THERE IS NO SEPARATE LICENSE AGREEMENT, THIS AGREEMENT ALSO GOVERNS YOUR USE OF ANY UPGRADES, UPDATES, PATCHES, AND HOTFIXES OF THE SOFTWARE THAT REPLACE OR SUPPLEMENT THE ORIGINAL SOFTWARE (COLLECTIVELY "UPDATES"), AND SUCH UPDATES WILL BE CONSIDERED SOFTWARE FOR ALL PURPOSES OF THIS EULA.

NOTE: LICENSOR DOES NOT LICENSE THE SOFTWARE TO INDIVIDUALS.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS EULA, OR IF YOU ARE AN INDIVIDUAL, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE SOFTWARE OR, IF THE SOFTWARE HAS BEEN DELIVERED BY CD ROM, DESTROY THE CD ROM OR RETURN IT OR, IF THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED AS A SERVICE, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE. IF THE SOFTWARE HAS ALREADY BEEN DOWNLOADED THEN IMMEDIATELY DELETE THE SOFTWARE. IF THE SOFTWARE HAS ALREADY BEEN USED THEN IMMEDIATELY STOP USING THE SOFTWARE. IF APPLICABLE, YOU WILL BE REFUNDED. ONCE THE SOFTWARE HAS BEEN USED OR INSTALLED, ALL OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS EULA APPLY, EVEN IF THE SOFTWARE IS SUBSEQUENTLY DELETED OR RETURNED. ANY USE OF THE SOFTWARE BY THE LICENSEE SHALL CONSTITUTE UNQUALIFIED ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

WARNING - READ CAREFULLY: THE PURPOSE OF THE SOFTWARE IS TO ANALYZE WEB APPLICATIONS CODED IN PHP PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IN ORDER TO DETECT SECURITY VULNERABILITIES AND PROVIDE INFORMATION TO HELP REMEDIATING SUCH VULNERABILITIES. FOR CORRECT AND SOUND ANALYSIS IT IS NECESSARY TO RECOGNIZE ALL POSSIBLE FUNCTIONALITY THAT IS CONTAINED IN A WEB APPLICATION'S SOURCE CODE. HENCE, NO EFFORTS ARE TAKEN BY THE SOFTWARE TO PROVIDE PROTECTION AGAINST A MAXIMUM POWER CONSUMPTION OF THE SOFTWARE WHICH CAN CAUSE (I) SERVER INSTABILITIES, (II) SERVER CRASHES, AND (III) LOSS OF DATA (COLLECTIVELY "UNAVOIDABLE EFFECTS"). IT IS THE LICENSEE'S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY AND DUTY TO (i) ALWAYS BACKUP ALL OF THE WEBSITE'S AND WEB APPLICATION'S DATA IN DUE TIME AND MANNER; AND (ii), WITH THE EXCEPTION OF RIPS' SAAS-VERSION-SERVER, ASSURE, TAKE CARE, AND GUARANTEE THAT THESE UNAVOIDABLE EFFECTS DO NOT HARM ANY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE OR DATA WHATSOEVER. IF YOU CANNOT OR WILL NOT GUARANTEE (i) THAT YOU ALWAYS BACKUP ALL OF THE WEBSITE'S AND WEB APPLICATION'S DATA IN DUE TIME AND MANNER; AND (ii) THAT, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF RIPS' SAAS-VERSION-SERVER, THESE UNAVOIDABLE EFFECTS DO NOT HARM ANY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE OR DATA WHATSOEVER, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.

1A. License and Support (ON-PREMISE-VERSION):
1A.1 Subject to the terms hereof, the ON-PREMISE-VERSION of the SOFTWARE is provided on a non-exclusive, non-assignable, and non-transferable basis, and may not be copied (except for back-up or disaster recovery purposes), modified, or enhanced without the advance written authorization of RIPS. The LICENSEE may make one or more copies for back-up or disaster recovery purposes, provided that the LICENSEE agrees to not grant access to such copies to any other individual, company or entity.

1A.2 Detailed specifications, requirements and limitations of the SOFTWARE are specified in the description of the license type YOU chose to acquire ("LICENSE TYPE DESCRIPTION"). The LICENSE TYPE DESCRIPTION is deemed to be part of this EULA.

1A.3 The ON-PREMISE-VERSION of the SOFTWARE permits the LICENSEE to use the SOFTWARE solely at his site. The maximum number of allowed applications to be analyzed by the SOFTWARE, and the particular period of time ("TERM") in which the SOFTWARE can be used, are specified (i) in the LICENSE TYPE DESCRIPTION, and (ii) in the invoice which accompanies the SOFTWARE and which is deemed to be part of this EULA, and (ii) can be looked up in the SOFTWARE'S user interface. The LICENSEE acknowledges that the SOFTWARE may contain technical functionality to stop operations after the TERM has expired, the LICENSEE fails to pay due fees, or violates this EULA in any other way.

1A.4 The ON-PREMISE-VERSION of the SOFTWARE is granted to the LICENSEE only and as such does not permit to sell, lend, assign, lease, or transfer in any other way this EULA, the related SOFTWARE or the license key (SOFTWARE and license key, collectively "LICENSE KEY").

This includes, but is not limited to, providing a mechanism enabling third parties to submit application scans. Any transfer or use in violation of this provision is prohibited and may cause the license to be terminated with no refund of any fees paid. It is the LICENSEE's sole responsibility to protect the LICENSE KEY from (i) any unauthorized access; or (ii) any unauthorized use. If -for any reason- the LICENSEE gets aware of (i) any unauthorized access to the LICENSE KEY; or (ii) any unauthorized use of the LICENSE KEY; or (iii) any incidents that my lead to an unauthorized access to the LICENSE KEY or an unauthorized use of the LICENSE KEY, it is the LICENSEE's duty to inform RIPS immediately.

1A.5 The SOFTWARE may only be used for its intended purpose of analyzing security vulnerabilities of web applications that are coded in PHP programming language with the goal of improving security of such web applications.

1A.6 The SOFTWARE may not be used (i) in any way that is unlawful, illegal, fraudulent or harmful; or (ii) in connection with any unlawful, illegal, fraudulent or harmful purpose or activity.
